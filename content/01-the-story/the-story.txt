Title: The Story

Hans JÃ¸rgen Wiberg, being visually impaired himself, got the idea about a video service for the blind utilizing the great cameras in modern smartphones and took it to StartUp Weekend in Aarhus and where a team of tech enthusiasts quickly formed and won the prize as the most innovative idea.

Since the volunteer team has expanded and have raised funds from 'Velux Fonden' in July 2013 enabling a small team to put all of their time into Be My Eyes. We hope to launch late 2013 or early 2014.
