Title: Our Team

Text: 

The initial team met at Startup Weekend Aarhus 2012 and have grown over time as new great people have joined. At present we rely solely on voluntary efforts  and we now have a diverse passionate team consisting of both developers, a graphic designer and non-technical/business people. Everyone is contributing to the project on a voluntary basis â€“ from both Denmark, Germany & Sweden.
