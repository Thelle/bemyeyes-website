The non-profit app Be My Eyes will connect blind people with a community of normal sighted volunteers. Both parties install the app and when the blind person needs help he/she uses the app which calls out to the network of volunteers and sends a live video stream from the blind person’s device to the screen of the volunteer’s device. This way the volunteers can “be the blind person's eyes” over the smartphone – therefore we’ve named it Be My Eyes!
